## What is Daytona?

Daytona is an open-source Development Environment Manager (DEM) licensed under the Apache License 2.0. Daytona allows you to manage and deploy Workspaces — reproducible development environments based on standard OCI containers, with built-in support for the Dev Container standard. Daytona’s architecture provides the future possibility to base Workspaces on other configuration standards, such as Dockerfiles, Docker Compose, Nix, and Devfile.

By leveraging configuration in a project’s remote Git repository, Daytona builds a Workspace and provisions a workspace to a platform of your choice. Once provisioned, you can develop and test the project using an IDE supported by Daytona, such as Visual Studio Code.

Daytona’s functionality is exposed through a command-line tool that runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows systems, on both x86-64 and AArch64 architectures.

For more information about Daytona, visit the [Daytona documentation site](https://www.daytona.io/docs/).
